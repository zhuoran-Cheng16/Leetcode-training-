# [2. Add Two Numbers(Medium)](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/add-two-numbers)
## 题目:
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

* You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


**示例:**

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
